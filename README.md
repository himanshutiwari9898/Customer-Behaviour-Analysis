# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis
## Overview
This project performs end-to-end data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large customer transactions dataset to uncover spending patterns and customer behavior trends. The analysis supports customer segmentation and retention-focused insights.

## Dataset
- 50,000+ customer transaction records
- Raw dataset includes missing values, duplicates, inconsistent categories, and outliers
- Cleaned dataset is generated through a structured data cleaning pipeline

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Load and inspect raw transactional data  
2. Identify data quality issues (nulls, duplicates, outliers)  
3. Clean and standardize the dataset  
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
5. Generate insights related to customer behavior and spending patterns  

## Key Outcomes
- Identified high-value customers and skewed spending distribution
- Analyzed category-wise revenue contribution
- Uncovered seasonal trends in customer purchases
- Produced analysis-ready data for segmentation and retention use cases

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – Raw and cleaned datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Data cleaning and EDA notebook  
- `visuals/` – Generated plots (optional)  

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
